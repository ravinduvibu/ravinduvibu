## About Me

I'm a passionate 2nd year Information Technology undergraduate at the University of Colombo School of Computing, focusing on building scalable, impactful solutions for real-world challenges.

With hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development, I specialize in API design, microservices, and robust backend systems. I also have a strong background in Linux server management, enabling smooth deployment and maintenance of production-ready applications.

I'm familiar with AI tools, N8N automation workflows, RAG chatbots, and CI/CD pipelines for streamlined development processes. I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional teams and love solving complex problems that deliver tangible results.

I'm always eager to learn, grow, and collaborate on innovative projects. **Feel free to connect or reach out!**
